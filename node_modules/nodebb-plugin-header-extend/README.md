#nodebb-plugin-header-extend

This simple plugin allows for customization of the site menu.

##Installation

Two options:

 1.  Install the plugin through the ACP (if it ever gets added to the list *cough cough*)
 2.  Run `npm install nodebb-plugin-header-extend` in the root directory of the NodeBB install

Don't forget to restart after installing and activating the plugin. After installing, an entry should appear in the menu in the ACP.

Everything you need to know is on that page.
